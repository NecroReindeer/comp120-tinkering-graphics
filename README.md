#COMP120 Tinkering Graphics Project

Please see README.md in the Appropriation Art Exhibit folder for documentation relating to the application.

**Please note:**  
The repository for this assignment isn't forked from the Falmouth-Games-Academy one because I has made a lot of progress on this project in my own repository before the Falmouth-Games-Academy one was created.
Had to delete the forked one for pull requests that I was copying code from this into as its been causing me loads of problems/confusion... (Ignore the recent commit titled 'test', that arose from those problems...)

## Trello Board

### Tinkering Graphics Sprint
The tasks in the backlog were extra features not required for the assignment that I was only going to add if I had spare time.
