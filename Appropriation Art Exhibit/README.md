#COMP120 Tinkering Graphics Project
Source code contained within exhibit.py.

Currently the dot effect does not draw circles at the edge if the last pixel of the image is not a multiple of the step the function iterates in. The background of the resulting image is now a solid colour, so this is not as noticible. However, I still intend to fix it. 

Some methods can be made more general, such as the one that returns a list of pixel coordinates in a square.

I intend to make the colour changing effect work with both RGB and RGBA images, as currently it only works with RGB.
